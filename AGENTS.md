# Branch and Worktree Policy

## Repository role

- This is the static Astro marketing site only.
- Customer features belong to `fiducia-customer.rs`; operator features belong to
  `fiducia-admin.rs`.
- Do not add login, customer account, API-key, or admin workflows here.

- Work directly on the `main` branch for now.
- Before making changes, confirm that `main` is the checked-out branch.
- Do not create or use feature branches.
- Do not create or use Git worktrees.
- Merge any existing non-`main` branch into `main` with an intent-preserving merge, resolve conflicts semantically, and continue work on `main`.
- Push completed work to `origin/main`.
- Preserve existing uncommitted work and stop for operator guidance if moving to
  `main` cannot be done safely.

## Syncing with the remote

"Sync with the remote" (or just "sync") is **bidirectional and always contacts
the remote** — it fetches *and* pushes, never push-only. A clean local working
tree does **not** by itself mean "synced": a sync is not finished until local
and the remote have exchanged commits in both directions.

How to sync:

1. `git fetch --all --prune` — always safe; it only updates remote-tracking
   refs and never touches your working tree, so run it any time.
2. Make the working tree **clean before you pull/merge**: `git add` +
   `git commit` your work (or `git stash`). **Only `git pull` / `git merge`
   when the tree is not dirty** — pulling into a dirty tree makes git refuse
   the merge or tangle uncommitted edits with the incoming commits.
3. `git pull` (which fetches + merges) — or `git merge` the upstream tracking
   branch — to integrate the remote's commits into your now-clean branch.
4. `git push` — publish your commits so the remote has them too.

Integrate with **`git merge`** / **`git pull`** (which merges). **Never
`git rebase`** to sync — it rewrites history and breaks shared branches.
