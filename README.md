# fiducia-ui

The [Astro](https://astro.build) front-end for **fiducia.cloud** — the marketing
homepage for Raft-based consensus & coordination as a service.

- Purple + navy theme, fully static output.
- Built behind a gateway path prefix, so `base` is `/fiducia` (override with
  `PUBLIC_BASE=/` to serve at a domain root).

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:4321/fiducia/
npm run build      # -> dist/
npm run sync       # build + copy dist/ into ../fiducia-backend.rs/static/
```

The Rust backend (`../fiducia-backend.rs`) serves the built site. After changing
anything here, run `npm run sync` and commit the regenerated `static/` in the
backend repo.

Everything in `public/` is copied verbatim into `dist/` and served, and every
non-underscore-prefixed file in `src/pages/` becomes a live route — don't put
anything in either place that shouldn't be published (directory intent docs in
`src/pages/` are named `_README.md` for this reason).

## Security posture

- **Fully static, no secrets in the bundle.** Output is static HTML/CSS/JS. The
  only build-time env is `PUBLIC_BASE` (a URL path prefix) — no API keys, tokens,
  or credentials are inlined. `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 0 vulnerabilities.
- **No user data / no request-derived XSS sinks.** The marketing pages render
  only static, author-controlled content; there is no
  `innerHTML`/`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and no request-derived interpolation.
  The single `set:html` (the hero terminal snippet in `src/pages/index.astro`)
  renders a build-time string constant — keep it that way: never pass
  request- or user-derived values to `set:html`.
- **HTTP security headers are set by the serving layer.**
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
  `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, a permissions policy, and
  a CSP are applied by `fiducia-backend.rs` in front of `dist/`. Note the CSP
  is currently just `upgrade-insecure-requests` (no source restrictions) so the
  backend's docs/diagram pages can load their CDN scripts — see the comment in
  `fiducia-backend.rs/src/main.rs`. The shell also carries
  `<meta name="referrer" content="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">`
  as defense-in-depth so full URLs don't leak to third-party origins.
