# workflows

GitHub Actions CI definitions for the fiducia-ui site.

- `ci.yml` — runs on pushes to `main`, PRs, and manual dispatch. Checks out this
  repo alongside its sibling `file:../` dependencies (`fiducia-interfaces`,
  `fiducia-test-config`) so `npm ci` resolves, then runs the Node contract tests
  and the Astro production build (the gating step). A separate `browser-e2e` job
  runs the Playwright/Puppeteer suite best-effort (`continue-on-error`) since it
  needs a real Chrome.
